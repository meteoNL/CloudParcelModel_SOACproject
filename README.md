This is the README of a cloud parcel model. For the techical details of the model, see the methods section of the report ("SOAC report" by authors of the model). For the default model run, run cloud_parcel_dynamical_mu.py.
The .py-file with "reality_attempt" in the title is supposed to represent a realistic convective cloud that could develops from mixed layer air with small perturbation in the environment of the radio sounding that is used as an input file. Several input files with data are available within this repository, but construction of such file is also an option. 

The figure_results subdirectory contain some results that can be produced by the model, for which model settings can also be found in the report.
